# PIG-DICE
Author: Jane  Wanjiru

Project Name: Pig Dice Game

## Description
This has  two players who  take turns rolling two dice. If both dice show 1, one's  turn ends and  loses a  score. If only one die shows 1, one's  turn ends and   earn zero points for that round. If neither die shows 1, add the two dice values to your score. You can continue rolling until you roll a 1 or choose to end your turn. The player who scores 100 or more points wins.
